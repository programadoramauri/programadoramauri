My focus is clean architecture, performance optimization, and engineering best practices. I've worked with international teams and high-traffic websites, always delivering robust and maintainable backend solutions.

- 🧠 Passionate about DevOps, terminal tools, and automation
- 🌍 Working remotely with global teams since 2020
